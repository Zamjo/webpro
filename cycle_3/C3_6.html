  <h1>CSS GROUP SELECTOR</h1> 
  <p>we can use a "class" or "id" to target a specific element so that some style can be applied to them. These are a particular type of CSS selectors that makes CSS styling distinct. But there is also another type of selector available that can use the collective elements for the style simultaneously. In this chapter, you will learn about the Group Selector in CSS.</p> 
  <p>Also it reduces the length of the code,Commas are used to seperate each selector in grouping.</p>
